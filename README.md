# MovieLens Ratings Analyis
## CSC 4740 Project

Our goal is to use the data from these two sets to analyze trends in films over time.
By drawing from these two specific sets, we will be able to find trends from both general audiences and critics.
This could then show if these two different spheres of film criticism follow each other or diverge from one another over time.

### Datasets:

[MovieLens Ratings](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)  
[Rotten Tomatoes Critic Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset)
